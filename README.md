# üìà AI Market Analyst Copilot

An agentic AI-powered application that delivers real-time stock insights, technical indicator analysis, intelligent news summarization, and LLM-driven trading recommendations. At its core, this tool acts as a fully autonomous Market Research Agent ‚Äî analyzing data, interpreting trends, summarizing external context, and forming its own conclusions, just like a human financial analyst.

## Agentic Design 

This application does more than just present data ‚Äî it operates as an **autonomous AI agent** capable of making informed trading recommendations. Here's how it works at an agentic level:

| **Agentic Behavior**   | **Implementation**                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Observation**        | Collects and monitors real-time market data (price, volume, technical indicators)  |
| **Contextual Awareness** | Uses Tavily AI to incorporate external context through real-time news summarization |
| **Reasoning**          | Applies financial analysis using Gemini LLM to interpret market sentiment           |
| **Action Suggestion**  | Suggests a course of action (Buy / Hold / Sell) with rationale                     |
| **Adaptability**       | Updates recommendations based on evolving market and news data                     |

Unlike fixed rule-based tools, this copilot uses reasoning to support deeper, more adaptive equity analysis.
